## Get Started

If this is your first time using Hugo, and you want to use this theme. Follow the instruction below:

```
mkdir name_of_web
cd name_of_web
git clone https://github.com/yursan9/manis-hugo-theme themes/manis
cp themes/manis/exampleSite/config.toml config.toml
hugo new blog/hello.md
```

Edit the `config.toml` according to your preference. Then edit `content/blog/hello.md` to
start writing your first post. (Look at the `exampleSite/content` for example.)

### Theme Only

To only install Manis, you can clone this repository. The following command will clone Manis in your site's base directory.

```
cd path/to/site/dir
git clone https://github.com/yursan9/manis-hugo-theme themes/manis
```

Ensure you have `blog` and `work` sections to make this theme works.

```
content/
├── blog
│   └── _index.md
└── work
    └── _index.md
```

## Configuration

For configuration example you can look at the `exampleSite/config.toml` (and copy that too!). I put some commentary to, hopefully, guide you at using this theme.

### Change Latest Section

You can edit which sections show up as latest posts and latest works by editing `mainSections` and `workSections`. `workSections` is optional.

```toml
# Configure which sections for Latest Posts
mainSections = ["blog", "post"]
# Configure which sections for Latest Works
workSections = ["work"]
```

### Custom CSS
If you want to make a change for this theme, other than forking, you can also supplied custom CSS. Maybe you want to change the font or size of image or icon, then custom CSS is your pal.

First, edit your `config.toml`, add the custom CSS filenames to `custom CSS`. You can supplied more than one custom CSS. Just be aware of the CSS load order.

```
[params]
    customCSS = ["/css/icon.css"]
```

Then, make a new `static/css/icon.css` file. After that you can write your custom CSS to that file:

```
.icon-social {
    width: 2rem;
    height: 2rem;
} 
```

If you follow the above instruction, you will change the size of icon on footer without forking the theme.

### Disqus Configuration
To add Disqus support, edit your site `config.toml`. Add your discus' shortname to `disqusShortname` and add list of sections that you want to support disqus to `params.disqusSections`:

```toml
disqusShortname = "your-disqus-shortname"

[params]
    disqusSections = ["blog"]
```

### Making Own Navigation Bar

Top navigation bar in Manis is made by configuring the navigation bar in `config.toml` with the following code:

```
[menu]
    [[menu.main]]
        name = "Blog"
        url = "/post/"

    [[menu.main]]
        name = "About"
        url = "/about"

```

### Other Language

Manis already translated to Bahasa Indonesia. But, if you want to translate this theme to your own language, look for the example in `i18n/en.yaml` and `i18n/in.yaml`.

And then you edit the site's `config.toml` like this.

```toml
defaultContentLanguage = "en"
[languages.{Your Language Code}]
    lang = "{Your Language Code}"
    languageName = "{Your Language Name. example; Bahasa Indonesia or Japanese}"
    weight = 1
```
